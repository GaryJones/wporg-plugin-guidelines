**4. Keep your code (mostly) human readable.**

Intentionally obscuring code is not allowed in the directory. Unfortunately, many people use such methods to try and hide malicious code, such as backdoors or tracking. In addition, WordPress code is intended for anyone to be able to learn from, edit, and adapt. Making code non-human readable, either by hiding it with `p,a,c,k,e,r` or uglify, or by using obscure naming conventions, forces future developers to face an unnecessary hurdle. Minified code may be used, however the unminified versions should be included whenever possible.
